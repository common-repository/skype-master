TechGasp Talk Master is the Skype supreme plugin for any Wordpress powered website.


== Description ==

Now that Microsoft bought skype and officially phased out live messenger, it was time to launch the ultimate skype communication tool for your wordpress. Skype Master allows you to display all 7 Skype action buttons, Call Me, Add Me, Chat with Me, View My Profile, Leave me Voicemail, Send Me a File.

Hold on, you don't need to show them all in the frontend, you can select each individual action to display in the front end. We packed this extension with the 2 famous skype colors (green or blue) to better suit your template.

The horizontal position works great even inside your pages and posts with our shortcode framework. Read more below and check screenshots page.

All the skype action buttons are available in 4 Widgets, Original Skype Buttons, New Microsoft/Skype Buttons and the "top of the line" TechGasp transparent, glossy, Skype Buttons. Also includes the new Skype Share Button to turn your website viral.

Again and as usual with TechGasp extensions, the code is pristine, error free and with fast page loading times. Professional or business pages need to be fast to google rank better and to avoid website visits drop outs.
